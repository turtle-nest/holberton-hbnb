# Swagger Documentation

Flask-RESTx automatically generates Swagger documentation for endpoints.

## 1. Introduction

- Goal: Test the various API endpoints to ensure behavior conforms to specifications.

- Test environment: Specify the URL of the test API (e.g. http://127.0.0.1:5000/swagger).

- Noticed: 500 errors are related to a missing database. A 500 (Internal Server Error) error usually indicates that there is a server-side problem, often caused by a lack of data management or an attempt to access a resource that does not exist (such as an unconfigured database)

## 6. Conclusion

This document outlines the test scenarios for various API endpoints of the project, including user creation and recovery, equipment management, and review operations. By executing these tests with Swagger, we ensure that the API behaves as expected and returns the correct HTTP status codes for different situations.
