# Project Overview â€“ HBnB

The HBnB project is divided into four main components, each focusing on a key aspect of full-stack web application development:

- **HBnB - UML**  
  Defines the project's architecture using UML diagrams, including class, package, and sequence diagrams, to visualize system structure and data flow.

- **HBnB - BL and API**  
  Implements the core **Business Logic** and **RESTful API** endpoints that manage users, places, amenities, and reviews, ensuring modular and scalable backend interactions.

- **HBnB - Auth & DB**  
  Adds user authentication mechanisms (signup/login with hashed passwords) and integrates a relational **database** (via SQLAlchemy) to persist application data.

- **HBnB - Simple Web Client**  
  Provides a lightweight front-end interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing users to interact with the API and view or submit data dynamically.
